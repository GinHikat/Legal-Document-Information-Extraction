# Legal-Document-Information-Extraction

This project focuses on the use of NLP techniques for the Information Extraction task from Vietnamese Legal Document, this includes the Metadata Extraction and Relation Extraction subtasks.

The training dataset for the NER model used for the ME task is collected manually by extracting the first/ last sentences from about 20 documents and annotated by Label-Studio.

The training dataset for the RE model is taken from a Previous work about Joint Entity Relation Extraction for Vietnamese Legal Document from Nguyen et al (2023): https://github.com/mlalab/VNLegalText/tree/main

This is a pre-requisite step for a larger project involving the construction of Vietnamese Legal Document Knowledge Graph for optimizing the Context Retrieval
